* No overhead: Minimal runtime

* Safe & Efficient: Zero-cost & safe abstractions

* Productive: Cargo + crates.io Ecosystem

* 1st class Wasm support

* Rust has an integrated test and benchmark runner, a linter, a code formatter and syntax highlighting
in most modern text editors.

* Rust data structures are very compact - in many cases even more compact than in C,
since the compiler reorders struct fields to make each type as small as possible.
Size is important in the space-constrained world of blockchains.
