## What is the Canvas Test Network?

We have [a demonstration testnet](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fcanvas-rpc.parity.io) running.
You can request some tokens to play with from our [Faucet](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#canvas_faucet:matrix.parity.io) and deploy your contracts via the [Canvas UI](https://paritytech.github.io/canvas-ui/#/upload).

The [Canvas UI](https://paritytech.github.io/canvas-ui/#/upload) can also be used to deploy your contract to e.g. a Substrate chain which you run locally and execute calls there.
If you want a quickstart you can use our [canvas-node](https://github.com/paritytech/canvas-node#note) project â€’ a simple Substrate blockchain which is configured to include the `contracts` pallet (see [How it Works](#how-it-works) for more).
