## What it is

[`cargo-contract`](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract) is a CLI tool for helping setting up
and managing WebAssembly smart contracts written with ink!.

You can install it this way:

```
cargo install cargo-contract --force
```

Use the `--force` to ensure you are updated to the most recent `cargo-contract` version.

In order to initialize a new ink! project you can use:

```
cargo contract new flipper
```

This will create a folder `flipper` in your work directory.
The folder contains a scaffold `Cargo.toml` and a `lib.rs`, which both contain the necessary building blocks for using ink!.

The `lib.rs` contains our hello world contract â€’ the `Flipper`, which we explain in the next section.

In order to build the contract just execute these commmands in the `flipper` folder:
```
cargo contract build && cargo contract generate-metadata
```

As a result you'll get a file `target/flipper.wasm` and `target/metadata.json`. Those need to be used when deploying the contract.
