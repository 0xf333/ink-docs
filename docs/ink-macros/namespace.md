## `#[ink(namespace = "..")]`

Applicable to ink! trait implementation blocks.

Changes the resulting selectors of all the ink! messages and ink! constructors within the trait implementation. Allows to disambiguate between trait implementations with overlapping message or constructor names. Use only with great care and consideration!
