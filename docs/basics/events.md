An event is a mean of recording, for the benefit of the off-chain world, that some particular state transition happened. 

See our [`ERC20 example contract`](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/blob/master/examples/erc20/lib.rs) 
for an elaborate example which uses events.

## Event Definition

This is how an event defintion looks:

```rust
#[ink(event)]
pub struct Transferred {
    #[ink(topic)]
    from: Option<AccountId>,

    #[ink(topic)]
    to: Option<AccountId>,

    amount: Balance

}
```

Add the `#[ink(topic)]` attribute tag to each item in your event that you want to have indexed.
A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself if somebody might want to search for this topic.
For this reason the `amount` in the exemplary event above was not
made indexable â€’ there will most probably be a lot of different events with
differing amounts each.


## Emitting Events in a Constructor

In a constructor events are emitted via `Self::env().emit_event()`.
See this example:

```rust
#[ink(constructor)]
pub fn new(initial_value: Balance) -> Self {
    let caller = Self::env().caller();
    let mut balances = HashMap::new();
    balances.insert(caller, initial_supply);

    Self::env().emit_event(Transferred {
        from: None,
        to: Some(caller),
        amount: initial_supply
    });

    Self { total_supply: initial_supply, balances }
}
```

## Emitting Events from Messages

In a message events are emitted via `self.env().emit_event()`:

```rust
#[ink(message)]
pub fn transfer(&mut self, to: AccountId, amount: Balance) -> Result {
    let from = self.env().caller();
    // implementation hidden
    self.env().emit_event(Transferred {
        from: Some(from),
        to: Some(to),
        amount
    });
    Ok(())
}
```

## Anonymous Events

`#[ink(anonymous)]`

Applicable to ink! events.

Tells the ink! codegen to treat the ink! event as anonymous which omits the event signature as topic upon emitting. Very similar to anonymous events in Solidity.
