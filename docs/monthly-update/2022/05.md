## Workshops & Talks ðŸŽ¤

[Michi](https://github.com/cmichi) gave a workshop for the ChainLink spring hackathon: [YouTube link: 
Parity's ink! 101 | Write Smart Contracts for Substrate-Based Chains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J6BsbOaedw).

## `awesome-ink` Repository ðŸ¤©

Following popular demand we've created
[https://github.com/paritytech/awesome-ink](https://github.com/paritytech/awesome-ink) â€’
a curated list of awesome projects related to ink!.

## Playground ðŸ•¹

The ink! playground has been published at [https://ink-playground.substrate.io](https://ink-playground.substrate.io)!

It's handy for a couple of things. For example:

* You want to experiment with developing a contract without having to set up Rust locally.
* You run into an error and want to share a permalink to a code example, so that somebody
can help you find the issue. This can be very helpful in case you post a question e.g. on our
[StackExchange](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ink?tab=Votes) site.

## Releases ðŸ†•

For ink! we released [v3.1.0](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/releases/tag/v3.1.0),
for [`cargo-contract`](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/) we released
[v1.4.0](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/releases/tag/v1.4.0).
The release notes contain more details.

## The URL to this portal changed

It's now available at [https://ink.substrate.io](https://ink.substrate.io).

## Canvas Testnet âžœ Contracts Testnet

We've renamed our "Canvas" testnet to "Contracts" testnet.
